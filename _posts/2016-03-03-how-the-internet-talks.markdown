*Well, the mostly young and mostly male users of Reddit, anyway.*
(Olson & King 2015)

This project examines the use of language on Reddit, with an aim to compare word trends across time. Olson and King (2015) parsed every comment on Reddit from late 2007 through August 2015. From this data, a tool was built which can plot graphs comparing the usage frequency of selected words over time. The tool also provides users the ability to share their generated graphs on Reddit or Twitter.

The shear volume of data involved in a project such as this necessitates a digital medium. As of June 2015, Reddit had over 200 million users who have collectively posted more than 1.7 billion posts (Olson & King 2015). By automating the process of data collection, the authors are able to readily access data about word trends on the internet in a quantifiable way that is simply not possible with more traditional approaches to such research. However, despite collecting a large amount of data, potential analysis depth is very limited. Namely, the project lacks contextual data on the discursive space the words are used in. There is no data collected on how, where or when words are used, what they respond to, or how their connotative properties may change. That is, there is no way to analyse how the words interact - whether a “wtf” is used in playful surprise, disagreement or anger. Nonetheless, to analyse these elements would require a much greater degree of complexity in the project code. 

In many ways, the project’s simplicity is its greatest strength. The project mines a large amount of data in a fairly trivial manner, whilst providing access to that data in a simple and easily understood way. Further, because the tool allows users to search any combination of words, the data is not limited to the value structures inherent in the research design. The researchers have not nominated specific sets of words to be valued and counted – they have counted the whole of all sets. This allows future research projects to adapt the available data to their needs. For instance, I have used the tool to generate a graph comparing the usage of the terms “Troll”, “Trolling”, “Harassment” and “Bullying” (see link for graph). There is a significant spike to the term “troll” around 2011. This correlates with my observations of a significant mass-media moral panic surrounding this topic, particularly in regards to “RIP Trolling”, at this time. Also of note is a recent decline in the use of the terms “Troll” and “Trolling” alongside spikes in the “Harassment” term. This may indicate a discourse shift to a greater level of delineation between trolling and harassment behaviours.

That the authors note a predominantly male user-base aged under 35 years old highlights an area for potential improvement: namely, demographic breakdowns of word usage. This could be achieved, for instance, by collecting data on users’ profile information and the sub-Reddit they posted in, or by widening the data collection to include other websites with different demographic profiles. Nonetheless, increasing the dimensional space of the tool is likely to impact upon both simplicity and accessibility.
